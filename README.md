## How to use

Initialize jupyter lab, and run the **00_data** and the
**01_spherical_projections** notebooks.

Now, use the **02_image_generator** notebook to generate the images. For
this, you’ll need to adjust the following hyperparameters:

- FOLDER_PATH: The path to the sequences, for example,
  “../point_clouds/semantic_kitti/”. The script will look for the
  *velodyne* and *labels* folder, as in the Semantic KITTI format.
- batch_size: The number of images that will be loaded in each
  iteration. For 16GB of RAM, aim for a size around 500.

An output folder will be created at *Cloud2DImageConverter/results*,
containing the reflectance, depth, and label images. It’s important to
note that this folder will be removed and recreated each time you run
the script, so remember to save your images.
